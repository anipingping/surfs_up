# Surfs Up!

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to compare the observed temperatures in the month of June with the observed temperatures in December in order to see if the surf shop can remain open year-round and, therefore, be a viable financial investment. Based on this analysis, the surf shop should be able to remain open year-round.

## Results
The tables below show the summary statistics for the observed temperatures in June and December, respectively:

### Three Takeaways
1. As shown in the tables above, the mean temperature varies from about 75 degrees in June to about 71 degrees December, a variance of about 5 percent, which is quite small.
2. The minimum observed temperature in June was 64 degrees, for December it was 56 degrees, a variance of about 12 percent. This difference is a little wider but is only one day of observation. The more interesting pattern for this analysis is the mean temperature over the two months.
3. The standard deviation for June was 3.25 degrees and for December was 3.74 degrees. This means that about 68 percent of the days in June are going to be between 71-78 degrees and about 68 percent of the days in December will be between 67 and 74 degrees. Both months have very mild, pleasant weather that is at or slightly above room temperature. 


## Summary
This analysis compared the observed temperatures in the months of June and December to determine if the proposed surf shop can remain open year-round or remain open in the winter months when the temperatures decrease. This analysis demonstrated that the change in temperature between the 2 months is quite small. The temperatures in December are likely to remain between 67 and 74 degrees, perfect for surfing. 

But is that enough of an analysis? I don't think so. I think it would be helpful to look at observed precipitation amounts for both months. December might be warm, but is it also rainy? Is it TOO rainy for people to want to surf? Does rainy weather even matter? My hypothesis is that a bunch of people who want to get into the ocean and get wet when it is otherwise quite warm and pleasant probably won't care whether it is raining. Who cares if it's raining if you're soaking in warm ocean water? But we should see just how much it is raining. Maybe people won't want to drive in their car during a downpour, for example, in which case we might want to consider closing the surf shop in the rainiest months of the year. But this remains to be seen with further analysis.

Additionally, we should try to determine whether the water temperature varies significantly between June and December. Personally I wouldn't care whether if the air temperature was 60 or 80 degrees if the water temperature was comfortable. Surfers are probably going to spend hours floating in the water, so it would be better for the surf shop's viability if the water temperature stayed pleasant year-round. We need to look at that, too.

## BONUS ANALYSIS

My bonus analyis tried to find significant variance in precipitation between June and December. It is still not known whether rainfall defined as observed amount of precipitation would matter significantly to people who want to surf in the ocean and spend hours wet, particularly if, as already seen, the air temperature is pleasant. And the tables shown below do not yield much insight. June is a drier month than December, but not by much.
